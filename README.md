It's set to Circuit Sandbox by default, to change to Production, you need to edit the Uri inside the .\Config\Config.psd1 file.
I strongly suggest you learn and familiarize with it well enough in the Sandbox 
before you attempt to use any of this in a production environment.

**Installation**

From PowerShell as admin: 
```powershell 
Install-Module PSCircuit
```


For offline environments, download, unzip and from PowerShell as admin:
```powershell
Import-Module "{FullPath}\pscircuit-master\PSCircuit.psd1"
```
