**What's my purpose?**

The purpose of PSCircuit is to trigger automation directly from Circuit. It achieves this by abstracting Circuit's REST APIs inside simple PowerShell cmdlets to send messages and read data from Circuit, and also by integrating a ChatOps workflow within Circuit itself to execute tasks on local or remote computers. This allows integration across multiple tools to run automation tasks from a Circuit Conversation or Space, allowing the use of Circuit as a production tool.

**How does it work?**

A bot listens and interacts with Circuit Conversations and runs automation tasks based on predefined keyword commands.
The automation comes in the form of PowerShell scripts, both the module and PowerShell are now cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) and can be used to glue together any other languages or technologies, such as Python scripts, Ansible scripts, AWS/GCP/Azure, compiled executables, ServiceNow, SharePoint, O365 etc. The sky is the limit.

**What does it do?**

Automation! From Circuit Conversations or Spaces! This is NOT a ChatBot. It is a ProdBot!

**How difficult is it to get started?**

It's pretty easy, you just need your [Circuit Bot Client Credentials](https://circuit.github.io/oauth.html#client_credentials) and any computer with PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7. Other versions might work, but are not supported. PowerShell comes pre-installed by default with your Windows OS.

*  **Users:** No previous knowledge or skills required. Just the use of simple keywords to run commands.
*  **Admins/Operators:** Basic PowerShell is required in order to set it up and create scripts (keyword commands).
*  **Developers:** Intermediate PowerShell scripting and RESTful APIs knowledge.
